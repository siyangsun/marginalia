Hey! I'm Siyang. Welcome to my blog.
You can find out more about me [here](http://siyangsun.github.io/)
On this blog I'll generally post about projects or interests, or events in my life I feel I should share!



Here's some stuff about Jekyll, which is what I used to generate the static pages for this blog:

This blog was generated using Jekyll. This is the base Jekyll theme. You can find out more info about Jekyll at [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/)

You can find the source code for the Jekyll new theme at:
{% include icon-github.html username="jglovier" %} /
[jekyll-new](https://github.com/jglovier/jekyll-new)

You can find the source code for Jekyll at
{% include icon-github.html username="jekyll" %} /
[jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)
